PDF Files 
Scan – Create – Reduce File Size  
 
 
It is recommended that you purchase an Adobe Acrobat product that 
allows you to read, create and manipulate PDF documents.  Go to 
http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/matrix.html to compare 
Adobe products and features –Adobe Acrobat Standard is sufficient. 
 
 
Scanning Documents 
 
You should only have to scan documents that are not electronic, and 
when you are unable to create a PDF using PDFMaker or the Print 
Command from the application you are using.   
 
Signature Pages 
If you have a document such as a CV that requires a signature on a 
page only print the page that requires the signature –printing the 
entire document and scanning it is not necessary or desired.  Once you 
sign and scan the signature page you can combine it with the original 
document using the Create PDF From Multiple Files feature. 
 
Scanner Settings 
Before scanning documents remember to make certain that the 
following settings are activated on your scanner (settings may vary): 
 Document Mode 
 Scan to smallest size 
 Fast (lowest quality) 
 Grayscale or black and white  
 Resolution: 300dpi or less

Reducing File Size Options 
 
*WebDCU will accept files up to 2.0MB.* 
 
Here is a rough estimate for PDF file sizes: 
If the contents are pure text, like a CV, the file size is usually 10kb per 
page; therefore, a 1MB file will have about 100 pages.  If the file 
includes some pictures, the file size may increase. If the file is a 
picture, like a scanned license or certification, you may have different 
file sizes based on the picture quality.  In most cases, saving the file at 
about 250kb per page should be enough to generate a clear picture. 
 
Option 1 – Use Adobe PDF Print Command: 
1. Open the PDF file, and choose File > Print. 
2. Choose Adobe PDF from the printer menu next to Name. 
3. Click the Properties (or Preferences) button to customize the Adobe 
PDF printer setting. (In some applications, you may need to click 
Setup in the Print dialog box to open the list of printers, and then click 
Properties or Preferences.)  Choose Smallest File Size as your default 
setting. 
4. In the Print dialog box, click OK.   
5. Save the new (smaller) PDF file. 
 
 
Option 2 – Use Adobe PDF “Reduce File Size”: 
1. Open the file in Adobe Acrobat and choose File > Reduce File Size...  
2. For our purposes, please make these files "compatible with" version 
Acrobat 5.0 or later. 
3. Save the new (smaller) PDF file.
